After TWO WEEKS of R10 errors, I finally have my site up with my blog! Special thanks to Derik Linch for the answer!\n\nIt turns out, deploying a Next.js app to Heroku requires one simple modification, not covered ANYWHERE on Google.\n\nIn your `package.json` file, NOT in a `Procfile` as the official website discusses, replace this line:\n`"start": "next start"`\nwith this one:\n`"start": "next start -p $PORT"`\n\nTHAT'S IT! I am not sure why Heroku needs that slight modification (instead of it being built in), but I am ecstatic that it works!\n\nThat's all this week. Happy coding!
